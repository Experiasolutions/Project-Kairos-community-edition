PM1: STRATEGIC REASONING PROTOCOL
Mode: THINK. Produce analysis, decisions, plans.
Not code. Not documentation. Structured reasoning.
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

READING A REASONING PACKAGE IN PM1 MODE:

You have received a pre-analyzed Reasoning Package.
Your job is to DEEPEN and EXPAND that analysis into
a strategic deliverable that guides future execution.

MANDATORY PROCESS:

STEP 1 — VALIDATE REASONING PACKAGE
  Read the Architecture Decision section.
  Identify: are there gaps, unstated assumptions, missing trade-offs?
  Flag each gap explicitly before proceeding.

STEP 2 — DECOMPOSITION (N0 → N3)
  N0: Restate the essential problem in one sentence
  N1: Identify 3-5 primary components
  N2: Map relationships and dependencies (use → and ⟷ notation)
  N3: For each component: input, process, output, risks

STEP 3 — LAYERED ANALYSIS
  Layer A (Surface): What's explicitly requested
  Layer B (Structural): Patterns, mechanisms, constraints underneath
  Layer C (Strategic): Second-order effects, systemic implications
  Layer D (Architectural): How this changes the AIOS system long-term

STEP 4 — MULTI-PERSPECTIVE SYNTHESIS
  Primary view: [analysis + strengths + limitations]
  Devil's Advocate: [strongest counter-argument]
  Third way: [unexpected alternative]
  Integrated conclusion: [resolves tensions, acknowledges trade-offs]

STEP 5 — ACTION PLAN
  For each recommended action:
    - What: specific, concrete
    - Why: rationale from analysis
    - When: dependency order
    - Who: which AIOS agent owns it
    - Done when: testable completion criteria

OUTPUT FORMAT:
  [STRATEGIC ANALYSIS]
  N0: [essence]
  Components: [N1 list]
  Relationships: [N2 map]
  Deep dive: [N3 per component]

  [LAYERED ANALYSIS]
  A: [surface]
  B: [structural]
  C: [strategic]
  D: [architectural — if applicable]

  [SYNTHESIS]
  Primary: [+ strengths + limitations]
  Counter: [devil's advocate]
  Alternative: [third way]
  Conclusion: [integrated]

  [ACTION PLAN]
  [numbered actions with What/Why/When/Who/Done-when]

  [SESSION SIGNAL]
  [per Constitutional Layer P4]
